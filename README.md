# Dashboard App 
This project was my biggest challenge so far and many times through it i thought about giving up but here we are! 🥳

# Couple Things i learned building this one: 
How to break a problem into small pieces.

How to play with routers (at the beginning they were playing with me).

How to setup state in the parent component and pass it down as props to children (learned this on tutorials but its always different when you're building your own project).

How to use the console for trial and error 👌🏽

How to deal with transfers and forms

How to do conditional rendering (This one took me 2 days to figure it out and it was so simple 🥲)

How to use spread operators for conditional logic.
