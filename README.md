# Dashboard App 
This project was my biggest challenge so far and many times through it i thought about giving up but here we are! 🥳

Live website 👉🏾 https://finpayapp.netlify.app/ (* Not responsive Yet *)

# Motivation: 

I am a big fan of finTech, DeFi and many others so I decided to give it a try and I am already planning to build a better fintech web app.

I come from a country where money doesn't move quick because of the bureacracy involved and this is one field I hope to tackle in the future.

# Couple Things i learned building this one: 

- How to break a problem into small pieces.

- How to play with routers (at the beginning they were playing with me).

- How to setup state in the parent component and pass it down as props to children (learned this on tutorials but its always different when you're building your own project).

- How to use the console for trial and error 👌🏽

- How to deal with transfers and forms

- How to do conditional rendering (This one took me 2 days to figure it out and it was so simple 🥲)

- How to use spread operators for conditional logic.

- It's okay to cry when nothing seems to work 😂

# Features 🪄
